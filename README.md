##

*Jacobi Forcing* is a new training technique that converts LLMs into native casual parallel decoders. Jacobi forcing keeps the casual AR backbone and fixes the AR-to-diffusion mismatch by training the model to handle noisy future blocks along its own Jacobi decoding trajectories. 

*Jacobi Forcing* yields an AR model which behaves like a diffusion-style decoder—decoding multiple tokens per pass, but still from left to right—with up to $4.5\times$ higher tokens-per-forward and $4\times$ wall-clock speedup on coding and math tasks, while retraining near-AR generation quality.

## Introduction

### Why faster decoding?

AR decoding is high-quality but serial: one forward pass per token. Diffusion language models can decode many tokens in parallel, but typically require **non-causal objectives** and often **break KV-cache-friendly serving**.

Jacobi Forcing bridges this gap by training an AR model to behave like a diffusion-style decoder while staying causal:
  - **Causal, left-to-right generation** with KV-cache reuse
  - Parallel token updates within a block of size $n$ (via Jacobi decoding) and training makes such convergence faster
  - Multiblock decoding and Rejection recycling to exploit higher-quality draft with higher GPU utilization

## Usage

### Training

Jacobi Forcing training involves the following steps:

#### Prepare training data

##### Choice A: download existing data from Huggingface.

```
git lfs clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/JacobiForcing/OpenCodeInstruct_training_data_n32w16
```

##### Choice B

- step 1: Collect Jacobi trajectories from a base AR model (intermediate states + fixed-point state for all $n-$token blocks).

```
# generate trajctories using customized models
bash generate_trajectory/generation/generate_trajectory_opencodeinstruct_greedy.sh
```

If the target model is not Qwen2.5, first modify `generate_trajectory/generation/generate_trajectory_opencodeinstruct_greedy.sh` to customize model path, trajectory data destimation, and input data path (you can download our length-bucketed input data from [this link for code](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JacobiForcing/OpenCodeInstruct_length_sorted) and [this link for math](https://huggingface.co/datasets/JacobiForcing/OpenThought2_length_bucketed)).

Then adapt from the script `generate_trajectory/generation/qwen2_modeling_jacobi_forcing_greedy.py` to make your target model compatible.

- step 2: training sequence packing and mapping noise schedule to training sequence.

```
python3 generate_trajectory/data/2_prepare_efficient_cllm_training_data_progressive_noise_window.py \
    --input_path {trajectory_data_path} \
    --output_path {output_training_seq_path} \
    --n_token_seq_length {block_size} \
    --window_size {window_size} \
    --min_noisy_ratio 0 \
    --max_noisy_ratio 1.0 \
    --strategy "progressive"
```

#### Noise-conditioned training over long horizons

```
cd /home/lah003/workspace/CLLM2/JacobiForcing
bash scripts/train/train_jacobi_forcing_coder_n32.sh
```

<p align="center">

  <br/>

</p>

### Inference

#### Multiblock Decoding

Jacobi Forcing decoding typically exposes knobs like:

- block size `n` (tokens updated in parallel)

- rejection recycling verification budget `pool_size`

- block count `K` (maximum blocks “in flight”)

- activation ratio `r`

<p align="center">
  <picture>

  </picture>
  <br/>
  <i>fig4: Illustration of multiblock Jacobi decoding with rejection recycling. High-quality n-grams from earlier iterations are reused as drafts.</i>
</p>

Recommended starting point (from our grid search):

`n=64, K=2, pool_size=4, r=0.85`

To run comprehensive grid search profiling for TPS speedup and TPF across different settings, run:

```
cd JacobiForcing
bash scripts/inference/scanning_hyperparameter_jacobi_decoding_mr.sh
```

To run a specific decoding setting with multiblock decoding and rejection recycling, run:
```
# vanilla Jacobi decoding
python3 JacobiForcing/jacobi_forcing_inference_humaneval.py

# with multiblock decoding and rejection recycling
python3 JacobiForcing/jacobi_forcing_inference_MR_humaneval.py
```


### Evaluation

#### Generation Quality Evaluation

  <i>*Here we report the strongest checkpoints released by the authors; in principle EAGLE-3 and HASS are lossless in comparison with greedy AR checkpoints if they were trained with the Qwen2.5-7B backbone. Note that SD has a worse acceptance length (TPF) to TPS conversion ratio due to other overheads in the algorithm like token drafting using draft head, tree-like verification overhead, feature merging from different layers etc.</i>

#### Performance Summary

Overall, Jacobi Forcing model consistently delivers **up to $3-4\times$ wall-clock speedup** on coding and math tasks with only minor accuracy changes versus greedy AR, while significantly outperforming both dLLMs and prior consistency-based parallel decoders in the accuracy–throughput tradeoff.


On a single B200 GPU with much higher FLOPs, the same Jacobi Forcing model with multiblock + rejection recycling can achieve an even more significant speedup at around 330 tokens/s (vs. around 80 tokens/s using AR), showing that the design continues to scale on newer accelerators.
